# gclass_poster
Python program using selenium to bypass the requirement of a Google API key for posting in Google Classroom

## Why is this useful?
This can be used for students in Google Classroom to make their own posts with images/documents (uploaded via Google Drive or other services). Some school districts do not allow for Google API access (and for good reason), but this program circumvents the requirement for a Google Classroom API if you are just posting assignments.
