# gclass_poster
Python program using selenium to bypass the requirement of a Google API key for posting in Google Classroom

## Why is this useful?
This can be used for students in Google Classroom to make their own posts with images/documents (uploaded via Google Drive or other services). Some school districts do not allow for Google API access (and for good reason), but this program circumvents the requirement for a Google Classroom API if you are just posting assignments.

## TODO
- Adding multiple links ("How many links do you want to enter")
- Auto upload and linking (Upload to a service like dropbox using an api and then posting a link to that image?)
- Cleaning up code
- More options in posting
- Generating credentials and storing them securely (hashing and prompting every time)
- Create a new post (new post function without quitting/starting new session) and move around classes (class id/name given and move to that)
